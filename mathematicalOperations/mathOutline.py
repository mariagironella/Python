#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
a = "Kaz " + "Brekker"
print(a)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
b = 4 + 8
print(b)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
c = 24 - 12
print(c)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
d = 15.4 - 3.4
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
e = 6 * 2
print(e)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
f = "pow " * 3
print(f)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
g = 36 / 3
print(g)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
h = 8.53 / 2.42
print(h)


#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
i = 9 % 4
print(i)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
j = 12 // 2
print(j)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
k = 2 ** 3
print(k)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
m = "hockey" - 2
print(m)
