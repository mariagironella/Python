#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
#Integer
a = 2
#Float
b = 3.14
#String
c = "Percy"
#Boolean
d = True
#List
e = [2, 4, 6, 8]

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)
varA = 1
vara = 2


#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
f = "Annabeth"

f = "Jason"

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
var = b


#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:
k = [1, 2, 3]
j = (k[1])

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:
string = "Maria"
h = "M"


#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:
print (b)


#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
varTwo == 4
