This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = ("kiwi" == "strawberry")
print(a)


#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
b = (2 == 2)
print(b)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
f = (8 > 6)
print(f)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c = (8 < 6)
print(c)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
d = (6 >= 9)
print(d)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
e = (6 <= 9)
print(e)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
g = (7 == 7
